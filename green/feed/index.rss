<p class="has-drop-cap">Eurowind Energy, a Danish renewable energy company, has inaugurated the Teiuș Solar Park, a EUR 55 million investment aimed at strengthening Romania’s green energy sector, backed by EUR 15 million in funding from Romania’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR).</p>



<p>With a total installed capacity of 60.2 megawatts (MW), the park is expected to generate approximately 103.59 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity each year, enough to meet the needs of more than 25,000 households. By doing so, the facility will help cut over 37,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually.</p>



<p>The park features a state-of-the-art internal transformation station (110/20kV, 80 MVA), allowing efficient connection to Romania’s national power grid. This infrastructure plays a vital role in ensuring the stability and reliability of renewable energy integration.</p>



<p>In addition to the solar facility, Eurowind Energy is developing a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) on the same site. With a planned storage capacity of 116.96 megawatt-hours (MWh), the BESS represents a separate €43 million investment, of which €7.6 million comes from non-reimbursable PNRR funding.</p>



<p>Teiuș is the fourth solar park developed by Eurowind Energy in Romania, following successful projects in Hălchiu, Măgurele, and Pufești. The company expects to operate a total of 124 MW of local renewable capacity by the end of 2025. Its broader Romanian portfolio under development includes approximately 8 gigawatts (GW) of solar, wind, hybrid, and storage projects.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Danish company Eurowind Energy confirms it is actively developing a significant wind energy project in Botoșani County, North East Romania. The initiative, currently in an early planning phase, aims to reach approximately 1,200 MW of installed capacity. </p>



<p>This project involves the phased construction of nine wind farms distributed across nine communes in northern Botoșani County, with a timeline for completion extending to approximately 2031. </p>



<p>Eurowind Energy priority in Romania remains the completion of two renewable energy projects scheduled to become operational this year: Teiuș photovoltaic park (60.2 MW) in Alba County and Pecineaga wind farm (48 MW) în Constanța County.</p>



<p>Previously, Eurowind Energy successfully developed three additional renewable energy projects in Romania: the photovoltaic parks in Pufești (Vrancea County, operational since 2012), Halchiu (Brașov County, operational since 2013), and Mihăilești (Ilfov County, operational since 2013).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">12 months after the launch of the Deposit Return System, managed by ReturRO, over 3 billion DRS containers were returned by consumers. The national program has seen better results monthly.</p>



<p>In October this year, the DRS reached a new record, with a monthly collection rate of 84%, up from September (80%) and August (78%). RetuRO has handed over to recyclers more than 200,000 tonnes of sorted and processed containers in centres across the country.</p>



<p>This year, ReturRO invested 60 million euros in a network of seven operational DRS packaging counting and sorting centres, with an annual processing capacity of over 7 billion containers. Plans to expand the regional centres involve opening two more units in the coming months.</p>



<p>Romania was the 11th European country to implement a DRS system, after Norway, Denmark, Germany, Belgium, Iceland, Estonia, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Latvia, and Lithuania. Romania’s Deposit Return System is the largest fully integrated system globally and the second largest after Germany.</p>
