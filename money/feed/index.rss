<p class="has-drop-cap">BYD (Build Your Dreams), the world’s leading electric vehicle manufacturer, has officially entered the Romanian market, offering an initial lineup of fully electric and plug-in hybrid models equipped with the advanced DM-i (Dual Mode – intelligent) technology.</p>



<p>At the top of the range is the <strong>SEALION 7</strong>, a fully electric SUV that accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in just 4.5 seconds. It boasts a maximum range of up to 502 km (WLTP) thanks to BYD’s revolutionary Blade Battery. The SEALION 7 is priced at <strong>€40,590</strong> (VAT included), and the premium version is <strong>€49,590</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1068" height="712" src="https://bucharestdailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BYD-Sealion-7.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-4759"/></figure>



<p>Also debuting locally is the <strong>SEAL U DM-i</strong>, a plug-in hybrid SUV powered by BYD’s Super DM technology. This model offers a combined electric and fuel range of over 1,000 km on a full charge and tank. Prices start at <strong>€34,890</strong> and go up to <strong>€41,890</strong> for the high-end Design version.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1068" height="712" src="https://bucharestdailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BYD-SEAL-U-DM-i.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-4760"/></figure>



<p>The <strong>ATTO 2</strong>, BYD’s third SUV for the Romanian market, also features the Blade Battery and Cell-to-Body architecture seen in the SEALION 7 and SEAL models. It comes with a 1.5-liter gasoline engine and starts at just <strong>€22,590</strong> (VAT included). The top-tier version adds €3,000 to the base price.</p>



<p>BYD&#8217;s sole sedan offering in Romania is the <strong>SEAL</strong>, which shares the high-tech construction of the SEALION 7 but with a more aerodynamic profile, enabling a range of up to <strong>570 km (WLTP)</strong>. Prices begin at <strong>€37,590</strong>, climbing to <strong>€42,590</strong> for the superior variant.</p>



<p>The first BYD dealerships in Romania have opened in <strong><a href="https://bucharestdailynews.com/metro/">Bucharest</a></strong>, hosted by Țiriac Auto and DAB Auto. The company plans to expand its retail footprint to over 30 sales points nationwide by the end of 2025, including cities like Ploiești, Brașov, Iași, Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara, Constanța, Pitești, and Craiova.</p>



<p>Founded in 1995, BYD made history last year by becoming the first car manufacturer in the world to produce over 10 million electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs). The company employs more than 110,000 engineers and technicians and files an average of over 40 patent applications daily.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">The World Bank has significantly lowered its forecast for Romania&#8217;s economic growth in 2025, projecting a rate of just 1.3%. This revised figure represents a notable downgrade and positions Romania with the lowest anticipated growth rate among the countries in the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region.</p>



<p>This updated projection is a substantial cut from the World Bank&#8217;s previous estimates and falls considerably short of the Romanian government&#8217;s more optimistic growth targets. The international financial institution attributes the dimmer outlook to a combination of factors, including heightened global uncertainty, rising trade barriers, weaker demand from key trading partners, and persistent domestic inflationary pressures.</p>



<p>Looking slightly ahead, the World Bank projects a modest acceleration in Romania&#8217;s economic growth to 1.9% in 2026. However, the lowered forecast for the upcoming year underscores the significant hurdles Romania must overcome in maintaining a robust economic trajectory amidst a complex and uncertain global economic climate.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Chinese automotive giant Chery has officially launched its operations in Romania, marking a significant step in the company&#8217;s accelerated expansion strategy across Europe. AUTO ITALIA has been assigned as the official importer of the Chery brand in Romania.</p>



<p>The distribution agreement will enable the local sale of TIGGO SUV models, starting in the second half of 2025. In 2025, Chery will prioritize the launch of the fourth-generation TIGGO7 and TIGGO8, both powered by Chery Super Hybrid (CSH).</p>



<p>Romania becomes a key market in the region for the brand, which has seen consistent growth in recent years, reaching over 2.6 million vehicles sold globally in 2024, a 38% increase compared to the previous year.</p>



<p>With a presence in over 110 countries and regions and more than 15 million global users, of which 4.5 million are outside China, Chery continues its international expansion and will launch its mass-produced TIGGO family models across several European markets later this year.</p>



<p>Chery’s European R&amp;D Center in Frankfurt will play a critical role in aligning Chery’s technologies with European regulatory frameworks and market dynamics, supporting adaptive development and enabling the creation of vehicles that are tailored to meet 100% European standards.</p>



<p>Founded in 1997, Chery is one of China’s largest automotive companies. It operates eight global R&amp;D centers and employs over 18,000 engineers worldwide. The brand is China’s leading passenger car exporter and was recently included in the Fortune Global 500 (ranked 385th as of August 2024).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">Romania is rapidly emerging as a key player in the e-commerce landscape of Central and Eastern Europe, with the sector showing no signs of slowing down. In 2024, the Romanian e-commerce market reached a staggering €7.7 billion, and experts predict that it will continue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.5%, reaching new heights by 2029.</p>



<p>As Romania’s e-commerce market expands, it is reshaping the logistics and industrial sectors. The demand for industrial and logistics spaces has surged, with the largest e-commerce players occupying approximately 1 million square meters of space. This represents around 10% of the national logistics stock, placing e-commerce companies among the top five largest occupiers in the country.</p>



<p>Key cities such as Bucharest-Ilfov, Timișoara, Cluj-Napoca, and Brașov are emerging as major hubs, thanks to their developed infrastructure and strategic access to critical transport corridors. These areas are increasingly attracting investment as companies seek to meet growing demand for faster and more efficient delivery services.</p>



<p>The growth of e-commerce is also influencing cost dynamics. Labor costs within Romania’s logistics sector remain relatively competitive compared to other European countries, making it an attractive option for investors looking to tap into the region’s expanding market. </p>



<p>However, with the increasing demand for logistics space, rental prices have climbed, reaching as much as €4.5 per square meter per month, depending on location and the quality of facilities, Cushman &amp; Wakefield Echinox reports.</p>



<p>Between 2025 and 2029, Romania’s e-commerce market is expected to generate €47.8 billion. The fastest-growing categories in this boom include grocery, home appliances, beauty products, automotive goods, and hobby-related items, as consumers increasingly shift their spending toward online retail.</p>



<p>The number of online shoppers in Romania has seen a sharp rise. In 2024, 10.2 million people made purchases online—representing 55% of the country’s internet users. A significant growth opportunity in the digital market relates to the low number of companies which sell online in Romania.</p>



<p>Their share is of almost 50% vs. the European Union average, despite the fact that the country can boast an internet penetration rate of 94% and more than 50% of the population is doing online shopping. </p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">This Easter, the online shopping basket looks different as consumer preferences continue to shift towards digital and practical products. Thus, gadgets, small appliances and tech-related gifts such as toys are among the most popular online purchases for the holiday season, chosen by nearly 4 in 10 Romanians, according to a survey conducted by Cargus.</p>



<p>Clothing and footwear, once essential symbols of Easter, have slipped to second place with only 27% of respondents choosing them. Some 22% will order food and drink online for the Easter meal and 17% will buy holiday-themed home and garden decorations. Notably, over a third of respondents (37%) say they don&#8217;t make any Easter-specific online purchases.</p>



<p>While home delivery remains the top choice for most Romanians (61%), alternative options are gaining ground. Some 44% of respondents say they also use fixed delivery points, with adoption significantly higher among younger consumers.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">In 2024, most of the vehicles imported into Romania came from Western Europe. According to carVertical, 32.3% of these vehicles were imported from Germany, 17% from France, 11.7% from Belgium, 11.2% from Italy, and 7% from the Netherlands.</p>



<p>The main reasons behind this trend are better vehicle maintenance and lower wear and tear. Cars from countries like Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands are typically in better condition, thanks to more stringent service schedules and superior road infrastructure.</p>



<p>On the other hand, used cars imported from Poland showed a higher risk of odometer tampering, with 14.3% of the checked vehicles displaying discrepancies. Other countries with notable odometer fraud rates included the US (13.9%), Spain (10.5%), Italy (10.3%), and Denmark (8.5%).</p>



<p>However, identifying odometer manipulation can be tricky. A car might arrive from abroad with a specific mileage, only for local sellers to alter the odometer reading in an effort to increase its market value.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Romanians interest in photovoltaic plants has increased 2 times in the first months of the year compared to the same period in 2024, and most homeowners (70%) want to cover their total monthly electricity consumption to achieve energy autonomy, according to data from Kilowat.</p>



<p>Thus, they install, from their own funds, photovoltaic panels of at least 5-6 kW and up to 15 kW, investing between 20,000 and over 50,000 RON in such systems, to reduce their energy bill by at least 70%.</p>



<p>For example, a 5-6 kW photovoltaic system with 5 kW storage, which costs 20,000 RON (4,000 euros), can provide total autonomy to a household with an average consumption of 300-500 kW/month.</p>



<p>Main investors in photovoltaic plants are families with average and above-average incomes, who live in houses of at least 80-100 sq m and have a high number of energy consumers in the household. They usually live in urban and peri-urban areas, especially Bucharest-Ilfov, Cluj, Sibiu, Timișoara, and Constanța.</p>
