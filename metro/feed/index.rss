<p class="has-drop-cap">FOMO, the Festival of Modern Owners, spans five days of conferences, workshops, live interviews, and over 30 networking events and community activations across <a href="https://bucharestdailynews.com/metro/">Bucharest</a>, between May 21-25, 2025. Tickets can be bought <a href="https://www.modernowners.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>Present at the pre-event press conference, His Excellency Giles Portman, the United Kingdom’s Ambassador to Romania said that <em>”FOMO aligns perfectly with the UK’s development agenda. We’ve surpassed £10 billion in UK-Romania trade. SMEs are engines of prosperity and need real support.”</em></p>



<p>BCR, the event’s main partner, was represented by Dana Dima, Vice President of Retail &amp; Private Banking, who added that <em>”FOMO is an open stage for Romanian entrepreneurs who want to believe in themselves. I believe in entrepreneurs who started from scratch and succeeded through consistency and courage.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Entrepreneurship is not necessarily about <a href="https://bucharestdailynews.com/money/">money</a> or financial independence, because honestly, I’ve never worked so hard for so little money! It’s 1% idea and 99% sweat. But when you believe in your project with all your heart, there’s no way you won’t succeed,”</em> confessed Adina Foldager, founder of Adinish, and FOMO speaker.</p>



<p>FOMO brings together over 60 Romanian entrepreneurs, alongside international guests such as Steven Bartlett, Simon Squibb, Dan Priestley, Sara Al Madani, and Jason Derulo, at Sala Palatului and other partner venues: Apollo 111, Nook, Grădina Alhambra, and Sala Luceafărul.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Wendy’s, one of the world’s most iconic fast-food chains, has officially opened its first location in Bucharest at Mega Mall, marking the brand’s second entry into the Romanian market following last week’s debut at the new Moldova Mall in Iași.</p>



<p>To celebrate the launch, Wendy’s unveiled a unique take on its classic logo, featuring a traditional Romanian touch: the iconic red-haired mascot now wears a hand-crafted „ie”, inspired by local motifs. This limited-edition design extends to the restaurant’s packaging, which is produced entirely in Romania.</p>



<p>The Bucharest location offers a menu tailored to local tastes, including Wendy’s signature square beef burgers, chicken sandwiches, chicken nuggets, the beloved Baconator, and the classic Frosty dessert. </p>



<p>Emphasizing freshness and local sourcing, all burgers are made with Romanian beef, while other ingredients such as whole chicken breast, potatoes, tomatoes, lettuce, and milk for the desserts are also locally sourced and prepared on-site.</p>



<p>John and Kathryn Chayka of JKC Capital, the franchise holders for Wendy’s in Romania, have ambitious plans for the brand’s future in the country. With an investment of at least USD 200 million, they aim to open 100 Wendy’s locations nationwide, creating over 5,000 jobs across Romania.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Global luxury menswear brand ZEGNA opens its first Negozio in <a href="https://bucharestdailynews.com/metro/">Bucharest</a>. The term is used by ZEGNA for its own stores, coming from the Italian language and means ”shop, business, store”.</p>



<p>Spanning two floors, the store at 11-13 George Enescu Street, near <a href="https://bucharestdailynews.com/more-luxury-brands-to-open-units-on-calea-victoriei-in-the-refurbished-stirbei-palace/">Calea Victoriei</a>, the city&#8217;s main commercial street, retains the building&#8217;s distinctive original architectural features, authentic parquet flooring, and a grand staircase highlighted by a glass display window, making it a focal point of the location.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">Over the past 15 years, the residential market in Țegheș village, 24 kilometers from Bucharest city center, has experienced steady growth, with the number of completed homes doubling from 3,274 in 2010 to 6,251 in 2023. According to the National Institute of Statistics, the usable area for which building permits were issued for residential units in 2023 reached 48,500 square meters, double the figure from 2010.</p>



<p>This sustained growth is driven by demand for larger homes in a quieter, greener environment. Today, Țegheș, part of the Domnești commune, is home to over 11,000 residents, 50% of whom are active individuals between the ages of 20 and 49, while 25% are children.</p>



<p>A key factor in this development is affordability: modern homes with private gardens range from EUR 120,000 to EUR 170,000, significantly lower than similar areas in Bucharest. For example, a four-room apartment in Cartierul Latin, approximately 120 square meters, costs EUR 110,000 + VAT, compared to EUR 152,000 + VAT in Drumul Taberei and EUR 196,450 + VAT in Ghencea.</p>



<p>As an example, Forest Vista project is located three minutes from the A0 highway junction and one minute from the new kindergarten in Țegheș. The kindergarten has a capacity of eight preschool groups and occupies an area of 1,000 square meters, following an investment of approximately 6.2 million lei.</p>



<p>Inspired by Scandinavian architecture, Forest Vista villas feature open designs, large glass surfaces, and premium finishes. Prices start at EUR 120,000 + VAT, and clients benefit from customized interior design by professionals.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Over 82% of residents believe that <a href="https://bucharestdailynews.com/metro/">Bucharest</a> is not ready for a major earthquake. In addition, nearly half of respondents (45%) have not taken protective measures yet, although they admit they should, and only 15% developed an action plan in case of an earthquake, according to Bucharest Community Foundation.</p>



<p>Forty-eight years after the devastating 1977 earthquake, fear of earthquakes remains high. 59% of Bucharest residents consider earthquakes a major threat, ranking them as the second biggest reason for concern, after personal health issues (70%), and 57% feel vulnerable in case of a major earthquake.</p>



<p>Fear of earthquakes is more spread among women (62%) compared to men (51%) and the highest levels of concern are found among residents aged 35 to 64. Young generations aged 18 to 24 are more optimistic, with 39% of respondents stating that the city’s preparedness is ”so and so”.</p>



<p>In the event of a major earthquake, Bucharest residents’ main concerns revolve around losing loved ones (83%), building collapses (75%), the risk of injury or death (67%), and losing their home (59%). Some fears are significantly more present among women, such as economic and social instability (37% vs. 24% among men) or loss of personal belongings (32% vs. 22%).</p>



<p>Although 49% of Bucharest residents feel informed about what to do in the event of an earthquake, 43% have not taken any precautionary or informational measures yet. At the same time, approximately 33% have never discussed emergency measures with their family, and 31% say they would only instinctively know what to do during an earthquake.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Residents of <a href="https://bucharestdailynews.com/">Bucharest</a> want a greener city, a more balanced urban development with less chaotic constructions and a focus on restoring and preserving historic buildings, an MKOR survey shows.</p>



<p>Thus, 7 out of 10 <a href="https://bucharestdailynews.com/metro/">Bucharest</a> residents believe that the main priority for the future of their city is to create a greener and more sustainable urban environment. They want to reduce pollution and expand green spaces.</p>



<p>Women in Bucharest are concerned about the quality of life in the city, with greater emphasis on sustainable development and environmental protection. They want a cleaner city with more green spaces and well-organized public transport.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mobility-and-transport-infrastructure-a-priority">Mobility and transport infrastructure, a priority</h2>



<p>For city inhabitants, improving mobility and transport infrastructure is essential. 60% of respondents want a city with a well-adapted infrastructure for bicycles and other eco-friendly means of transport.</p>



<p>The development of efficient multimodal transport and the construction of suspended roads are seen as solutions to decongest traffic and reduce pollution. Bucharest residents also want more balanced urban development, less chaotic construction, and a stronger focus on restoring historic buildings.</p>



<p>Economic development and the cost of living are significant to young people, who want a city that offers professional opportunities and affordable living. At the same time, Gen Xers aged 43-58 have a low level of interest in issues such as the economy, employment, and sustainable development.</p>
