<p class="has-drop-cap">ACSH Gheorgheni won its first national ice hockey championship title on Sunday evening, after defeating Corona Brașov 2-1 (1-1, 0-0, 1-0) in the final played at the new Sepsi Arena in Sfântu Gheorghe.</p>



<p>Roberto Gliga opened the score for Corona (08:38) and Daniel Trancă equalized for Gheorgheni only a minute later (09:24). Peter Vincze scored the winning goal in the final quarter (49:13). Gheorghieni the better team, as they had more shots on goal, 48:25 (6:23, 10:9, 9:16).</p>

Goal were scored by Andrei Vasile, Lauris Bajaruns, Maksim Asceulov and Mihail Georgescu. The red-blues had a better game (49 shots on goal to 17), as Miercurea Ciuc played with reserve players.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">The strange selection made by Mircea Lucescu for the opening match of the World Cup 2026 preliminaries immediately showed &#8220;results,&#8221; and Romania lost the match against Bosnia and Herzegovina, played at the National Arena in Bucharest.</p>



<p>Bosnia had the first chance of the match through Demirovic in the 2nd minute, and the goal fell into Niță&#8217;s net in the 14th minute when Kolasinac served Armin Gigovic who opened the score. Denis Drăguș missed the first big chance for the hosts in the 26th minute when he shot wide and failed to score from the penalty spot in the third minute of first-half extra time.</p>



<p>The second half saw Romania&#8217;s first shot on goal, with Răzvan Marin sending a dangerous shot past Vasilj in the 47th minute. After only six minutes, the ball fell to Tahirovic&#8217;s hand in the Bosnian box, but after a VAR check, referee Makkelie whistled for the game to continue.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Romanian Football Federation has launched the new national team kit, under the concept &#8220;The shirt that makes us seen&#8221;. This kit marks the start of a new phase for this generation, to qualify for the 2026 World Cup.</p>



<p>The centerpiece of the new collection is the yellow jersey, inspired by the iconic design worn at the 1994 World Cup, a landmark moment in Romanian football history. The national flag is subtly highlighted by stripes down the sides, visible from any angle.</p>



<p>This collection also includes two secondary kits, in red and blue, which for the first time will have a different design from the main kit. These kits, being used on the away games, further highlight the tricolor.</p>

<p>The shirts have been designed by Jean Popescu, a Romanian designer based in Copenhagen, who is passionate about football shirts and the stories behind them. This is not his first collaboration with the FRF: in 2023, he created the shirt&#8217;s dedicated font, inspired by the lines of the Infinity Column, Constantin Brâncuși&#8217;s famous sculpture, which also appears in a stylized form on the new kit.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">The match between Romania and Kosovo played in Group C of the UEFA Nations League, came to an unexpected end! Kosovan players walked off the pitch in the 90+6th minute after &#8220;Serbia, Serbia&#8221; was chanted from the stands</p>



<p>This decision is unjustified as no banners were displayed and no slogans were chanted referring to Kosovo&#8217;s belonging to the Serbian state. It all started after Rrahmani attacked Alibec from behind, a melee broke out between the players and supporters chanted &#8220;Serbia, Serbia!&#8221; The match was interrupted for over 40 minutes before being suspended.</p>



<p>On the field, Lucescu&#8217;s national team was inferior, which was the worst match played by the „Tricolori” in his term. On the other side, the Kosovars played better and created numerous chances to score, but were denied by Niță.</p>



<p>According to the statistics, Romania didn&#8217;t have a single goal-scoring opportunity, while the guests were clearly superior in number of shots (17-4!). The „Tricolori” excelled only in goalkeeping, with Niță making six saves and Muric not troubled by anyone.</p>



<p><strong>ROMANIA:</strong> Niță &#8211; Rațiu, Drăgușin, Burcă, Bancu, R. Marin, M. Marin (Șut 77), Stanciu (Olaru 46), Man (Alibec 64), Drăguș (Hagi 89), Mihăilă. <strong>Coach: Mircea Lucescu</strong></p>



<p><strong>KOSOVO:</strong> Muric &#8211; Hadergjionaj, Rrahmani, Dellova, Vojvoda, Rexhbecaj, Berisha, Zhegrova, Muslija (Asllani 82), Jashari (Bytyqi 82), Muriqi (Rrahmani 71). Coach: Franco Foda. <strong>Coach: Franco Foda</strong></p>

<p>The biggest identity theft in football history started in 1998 when CSA Steaua Bucharest, the Romanian Army sports club, offered a new NGO, Association Football Club Steaua Bucharest, the right to use its sports complex and manage the football team.</p>



<p>CSA Steaua Bucharest was part of this NGO and did not transfer its history, brand, and logo. Even more, the logo used by AFC Steaua, almost identical to the emblem of the Army Sports Club, is a trademark owned by CSA <a href="https://goool.ro/steaua/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steaua</a>.</p>



<p>A few years later, in 2003, Gigi Becali entered the stage, took full control of AFC Steaua, and founded a commercial entity, the actual SC FC FCSB SA. With the help of former leadership of the Romanian Football Federation and Professional Football League, he managed to replace AFC Steaua with SC FC FCSB SA in The Romanian First Division, right in the middle of the championship.</p>



<p>The move was doubled in 2004 by a request to CSA Steaua Bucharest for permission to register his own trademark „Football Club Steaua Bucharest”. The Army Sports Club does not grant permission for this, but he proceeds to register it anyway.</p>



<p>In December 2014, following legal action from CSA Steaua Bucharest, Becali&#8217;s backed club lost its right to use the “Steaua Bucharest“ trademark, and FCSB was summoned to change its name and logo.</p>



<p>After years of legal battles, all of them won by CSA Steaua Bucharest, the Army Sports Club is the only one that can use Steaua&#8217;s name, brand, and history, including 20 Romanian Championships, 20 Romanian Cups, 3 Romanian Supercups, one UEFA European Cup, and one UEFA European Supercup.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-is-steaua-bucharest-right-now">Where is Steaua Bucharest right now</h2>



<p>In 2017, CSA Steaua Bucharest reactivated its football section and started to play in the Romanian Fourth Division. The team managed to get promotions in the 2019–20 season in the Third Division and in the 2020–21 season in the Second Division.</p>



<p>This season Steaua Bucharest plays in the Romanian Second Division (League 2) and is currently in the 2nd position. The red-blues did not lose any match in the first 10 weeks, registered 5 wins, 5 draws, scored 9 goals, and conceded 4.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Romania&#8217;s Under 21 national football team qualified for EURO 2025 on Tuesday, after beating Switzerland 3-1 at Giulesti Stadium, in the last match of Preliminary Group E. It is the fourth consecutive qualification for the EUROs.</p>



<p>Tricolorii opened the score fast, in the 16th minute, when Ianis Stoica scored from Louis Munteanu&#8217;s pass. The Swiss had a huge chance five minutes later! Fink gets one-on-one with the keeper, but he shoots wide!</p>



<p>In the 28th minute, Louis Munteanu is roughly fouled by Jaquez, and Romanian coach Pancu has a nervous outburst and runs onto the pitch, yelling at the referee. Both Pancu, Jaquez and substitute Blănuță are red-carded and sent off.</p>



<p>Ianis Stoica makes it 2-0 in the 35th minute. Octavian Popescu and Grameni pass between them, and Louis Munteanu assists them. Hajdan pulled one back in the 65th minute, and only three minutes later defender Umit Akdag scored after keeper Keller denied his first shoot.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">The Romanian national football team recorded its third straight win in Group C1 of the Nations League, 3-0 in Cyprus. It is the third consecutive match in which the ”tricolors” score three times!</p>



<p>Romania scored first in the 16th minute. Rațiu broke down the right side of the box, rounded a defender, and passed to Răzvan Marin in the center. He sent it to the left, Mihăilă skipped the ball, and Man scored into the bottom corner.</p>



<p>Mihăilă goes down in a duel with a defender in the 24th minute, and the referee blows an extremely easy 11-meter kick, VAR does not intervene and Răzvan Marin executes flawlessly to make it 2-0!</p>



<p>In the 36th minute, Drăgușin scores his first goal for the national team! Man crossed impeccably from the long corner of the box and the Tottenham defender scored with a simple header.</p>



<p>Nothing happened in the second half,  and Lucescu&#8217;s national team has 9 points and leads the group. The next match is the return leg away to Lithuania on Tuesday, October 15.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Romania won the second match in Group C2 of the UEFA Nations League with the help of the referee, who, after consulting the VAR, disallowed a Lithuanian goal and easily awarded a penalty for the ”tricolori”.</p>



<p>Romania scored first in the 4th minute through Mihăilă after an excellent pass from Stanciu. Lithuania equalized in the 34th minute, through Kucys, after an attacking move that devastated the Romanian defense.</p>



<p>The Lithuanians managed to score in the 78th minute, Antanavicius heading home a ball after he had fought for it with goalkeeper Târnovanu, who was not completely in control of the ball. After VAR the goal was disallowed!</p>



<p>In the 87th minute, the referee awarded a penalty after Hagi was fouled in the box by Lasickas. After the VAR check, although the duel was clearly an easy one, the referee upheld his decision and Marin converted from the spot.</p>



<p>In the 90+2 minutes of extra time, Mitriță went on the counter-attack, sent the ball to Alibec, who passed to him and the Oltecan set the final score, 3-1 for Romania.</p>
