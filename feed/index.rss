<p class="has-drop-cap">BYD (Build Your Dreams), the world’s leading electric vehicle manufacturer, has officially entered the Romanian market, offering an initial lineup of fully electric and plug-in hybrid models equipped with the advanced DM-i (Dual Mode – intelligent) technology.</p>



<p>At the top of the range is the <strong>SEALION 7</strong>, a fully electric SUV that accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in just 4.5 seconds. It boasts a maximum range of up to 502 km (WLTP) thanks to BYD’s revolutionary Blade Battery. The SEALION 7 is priced at <strong>€40,590</strong> (VAT included), and the premium version is <strong>€49,590</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1068" height="712" src="https://bucharestdailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BYD-Sealion-7.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-4759"/></figure>



<p>Also debuting locally is the <strong>SEAL U DM-i</strong>, a plug-in hybrid SUV powered by BYD’s Super DM technology. This model offers a combined electric and fuel range of over 1,000 km on a full charge and tank. Prices start at <strong>€34,890</strong> and go up to <strong>€41,890</strong> for the high-end Design version.</p>

<p>The <strong>ATTO 2</strong>, BYD’s third SUV for the Romanian market, also features the Blade Battery and Cell-to-Body architecture seen in the SEALION 7 and SEAL models. It comes with a 1.5-liter gasoline engine and starts at just <strong>€22,590</strong> (VAT included). The top-tier version adds €3,000 to the base price.</p>



<p>BYD&#8217;s sole sedan offering in Romania is the <strong>SEAL</strong>, which shares the high-tech construction of the SEALION 7 but with a more aerodynamic profile, enabling a range of up to <strong>570 km (WLTP)</strong>. Prices begin at <strong>€37,590</strong>, climbing to <strong>€42,590</strong> for the superior variant.</p>



<p>The first BYD dealerships in Romania have opened in <strong><a href="https://bucharestdailynews.com/metro/">Bucharest</a></strong>, hosted by Țiriac Auto and DAB Auto. The company plans to expand its retail footprint to over 30 sales points nationwide by the end of 2025, including cities like Ploiești, Brașov, Iași, Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara, Constanța, Pitești, and Craiova.</p>



<p>Founded in 1995, BYD made history last year by becoming the first car manufacturer in the world to produce over 10 million electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs). The company employs more than 110,000 engineers and technicians and files an average of over 40 patent applications daily.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">Beginning June 15, 2025, Romanian airline DAN AIR will launch regular commercial flights between Damascus and four major European destinations: <strong><a href="https://bucharestdailynews.com/metro/">Bucharest</a></strong>, Frankfurt, Berlin, and Stockholm. With this move, DAN AIR becomes the only airline based in the European Union to operate direct flights to the Syrian capital.</p>



<p>The airline&#8217;s entry into the Middle Eastern market was made possible through bilateral agreements between Romania and Syria, as well as DAN AIR’s official designation by the Romanian Ministry of Transport in late March 2025. Syrian aviation authorities approved this designation at the end of April.</p>



<p>In addition to DAN AIR, several well-known international airlines operate flights to and from Damascus, including Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, Royal Jordanian, and Kuwait Airways.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-route-schedule">Route Schedule:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Bucharest &#8211; Damascus &#8211; Bucharest</strong>: Six flights per week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday);</li>



<li><strong>Damascus &#8211; Stockholm &#8211; Damascus</strong>: Two flights per week (Wednesday and Sunday);</li>



<li><strong>Damascus &#8211; Berlin &#8211; Damascus</strong>: Two flights per week (Tuesday and Saturday);</li>



<li><strong>Damascus &#8211; Frankfurt &#8211; Damascus</strong>: Two flights weekly (Monday and Friday).</li>
</ul>



<p>Founded in 2017 by Captain Dan Iuhas, DAN AIR operates both scheduled flights under its own brand from Bucharest and Bacău, as well as ACMI services for Romania&#8217;s national carrier TAROM and Blue Bird Airways in Tel Aviv. Since its founding, DAN AIR has transported over 4 million passengers.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">FOMO, the Festival of Modern Owners, spans five days of conferences, workshops, live interviews, and over 30 networking events and community activations across <a href="https://bucharestdailynews.com/metro/">Bucharest</a>, between May 21-25, 2025. Tickets can be bought <a href="https://www.modernowners.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>Present at the pre-event press conference, His Excellency Giles Portman, the United Kingdom’s Ambassador to Romania said that <em>”FOMO aligns perfectly with the UK’s development agenda. We’ve surpassed £10 billion in UK-Romania trade. SMEs are engines of prosperity and need real support.”</em></p>



<p>BCR, the event’s main partner, was represented by Dana Dima, Vice President of Retail &amp; Private Banking, who added that <em>”FOMO is an open stage for Romanian entrepreneurs who want to believe in themselves. I believe in entrepreneurs who started from scratch and succeeded through consistency and courage.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Entrepreneurship is not necessarily about <a href="https://bucharestdailynews.com/money/">money</a> or financial independence, because honestly, I’ve never worked so hard for so little money! It’s 1% idea and 99% sweat. But when you believe in your project with all your heart, there’s no way you won’t succeed,”</em> confessed Adina Foldager, founder of Adinish, and FOMO speaker.</p>



<p>FOMO brings together over 60 Romanian entrepreneurs, alongside international guests such as Steven Bartlett, Simon Squibb, Dan Priestley, Sara Al Madani, and Jason Derulo, at Sala Palatului and other partner venues: Apollo 111, Nook, Grădina Alhambra, and Sala Luceafărul.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">Romania has entered a decisive phase in its presidential election process after the first round of the highly anticipated rerun concluded on May 4. Nationalist candidate <strong>George Simion</strong>, leader of the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), emerged as the frontrunner, securing 40.96% of the national vote.</p>



<p>Simion, who ran a campaign centered on nationalism, traditional values, and Euroscepticism, will now face independent, pro-European candidate <strong>Nicușor Dan</strong>, who garnered 20.99%, in the runoff scheduled for May 18. Dan, the mayor of <strong><a href="https://bucharestdailynews.com/metro/">Bucharest</a></strong>, is widely seen as a moderate voice and has already begun consolidating support from centrist and liberal parties in a bid to counter Simion’s surge.</p>



<p>Former Liberal Party leader <strong>Crin Antonescu</strong> trailed narrowly behind Dan with 20.51%, failing to reach the second round, and his former ally, Victor Ponta (ex-President of Social Democratic Party), was voted by 13,05% of voters. The remaining votes were divided among several minor candidates.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-historic-rerun">A Historic Rerun</h3>



<p>This election rerun follows the annulment of the original November 2024 vote by Romania’s Constitutional Court, citing unprecedented levels of foreign interference. Intelligence reports and independent investigations found credible evidence of Russian hybrid attacks, including coordinated disinformation campaigns and cyber intrusion aimed at swaying public opinion.</p>



<p>That annulled vote had seen Călin Georgescu take an early lead before the results were thrown out. Georgescu was later disqualified from the rerun due to alleged campaign irregularities and a criminal investigation into his finances.</p>



<p>Simion stepped in as a replacement candidate for the nationalist bloc, quickly consolidating support from Georgescu’s base. His performance in the diaspora vote was particularly strong, winning over 61% of overseas ballots cast.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-divided-electorate">A Divided Electorate</h3>



<p>The results underscore a deepening divide in Romanian politics between a growing nationalist current and a pro-European mainstream. Simion’s critics warn that his rise may jeopardize Romania’s commitments to the European Union and NATO, as well as its stance on regional security amid Russia’s continued aggression in Ukraine.</p>



<p>In contrast, Nicușor Dan has vowed to strengthen Romania’s Western alliances and uphold democratic norms. Speaking on Sunday night, Dan said, <em>“This election is not just about Romania’s next president; it’s about the kind of country we want to live in.”</em></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next">What’s Next?</h3>



<p>The next two weeks will see a heated campaign as both camps rally their bases. Analysts suggest Dan will need near-unified backing from the center-left and moderate right to overcome Simion’s strong first-round momentum.</p>



<p>The runoff vote will take place on May 18, with international observers already deployed to ensure a free and fair electoral process. The outcome is expected to have profound implications for the country’s geopolitical alignment, democratic institutions, and social cohesion.</p>

<p>According to data from an exit poll conducted by Avangarde at 7:00 PM, George Simion managed to attract 30% of the vote, followed by Crin Antonescu and Nicușor Dan, each with 23%, and Victor Ponta (Independent) with 15%. Elena Lasconi (USR) only managed to convince 4% of the voters.</p>



<p>Another exit poll, conducted by CURS at 7:00 PM, shows George Simion was preferred by 33% of those who voted today, followed by Crin Antonescu with 22.90%, Nicușor Dan (20.90%), Victor Ponta (14.70%), and Elena Lasconi (4.7%).</p>



<p>The INSCOP poll also places George Simion in first for the presidential runoff, with 36.2% of today’s vote, followed in second place by the governing coalition’s candidate, Crin Antonescu – 21.5%. In third place is the independent Nicușor Dan, with 20.6%, followed by Victor Ponta with 17.1% and Elena Lasconi – 2.5%.</p>



<p><em>“I’m experienced enough to know that election victories are not decided by exit polls, and we cannot commit to anything based on them. We must wait to count every vote. When all votes have been counted and the results are officially in, we will talk about winners and losers,”</em> said <strong>Crin Antonescu</strong>, the candidate of the PSD-PNL-UDMR alliance, after polls closed.</p>



<p>He went on to thank <em>“everyone who gave me their vote. Thank you. I feel honored, and if this vote becomes a mandate to serve as President of Romania, I will carry it with the hope that they placed in me.”</em></p>



<p>In a recorded video message, <strong>George Simion</strong> said in his usual style: <em>“I want to thank you, brothers and sisters from here and everywhere. Together we made history today. We are approaching an exceptional result, far beyond what the system&#8217;s TV stations are showing (…) Congratulations! You are the winners! Today, the Romanian people voted—today the Romanian people spoke. It’s time to be heard!”</em></p>



<p><em>“Democracy is about communities—their problems, their aspirations—and tonight I want to congratulate the voter communities of each of my opponents for the debate they carried out, especially on social media, which in my opinion was much more substantial than the one we politicians managed to produce,”</em> said <strong>Nicușor Dan</strong> after the election process ended.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-many-people-voted">How many people voted</h2>



<p>Voter turnout at polling stations within the country was 47,80 %. Including votes from abroad, total turnout was 53,21 %, almost 10 million voters (9.571.740). In November 2024, at the same time of day, the turnout in the country was 51.19%, with 9,219,366 Romanians voting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced Friday evening the removal of Romania from the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), only four months after it allowed Romanian citizens to travel to the U.S. for tourism or <a href="https://bucharestdailynews.com/money/">business</a> without a visa.</p>



<p>The DHS statement, issued in coordination with the Department of State, confirmed the revocation of Romania’s designation under the program. ”Today, the Department of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Department of State, has terminated Romania’s designation under the Visa Waiver Program,” the announcement read.</p>



<p>In an official statement, The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MAE) emphasized that Romania had met all the necessary requirements to participate in the program, and called the U.S. decision ”disappointing and unjustified.”, expressing ”deep regret” over the move.</p>



<p>“We consider this decision to be unjustified and contrary to the strong strategic partnership between Romania and the United States,” said MAE spokesperson Andrei Zamfir. “Romania has fulfilled all technical and legal criteria for VWP inclusion, and we will continue our diplomatic efforts to restore this status.”</p>



<p>As of now, Romanian travelers will once again need to apply for tourist or business visas, a process that can take weeks or even months depending on demand and consular availability. The Romanian Embassy in Washington has said it will continue to advocate for Romania’s inclusion in the VWP and hopes the decision will be reconsidered in the near future.</p>



<p>The Visa Waiver Program enables citizens of approved countries to travel to the U.S. for up to 90 days without obtaining a visa, making it a coveted status that reflects a high degree of trust and cooperation. Romania had long campaigned for its inclusion, citing strong bilateral ties, a growing Romanian-American community, and compliance with security and travel standards.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Eurowind Energy, a Danish renewable energy company, has inaugurated the Teiuș Solar Park, a EUR 55 million investment aimed at strengthening Romania’s green energy sector, backed by EUR 15 million in funding from Romania’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR).</p>



<p>With a total installed capacity of 60.2 megawatts (MW), the park is expected to generate approximately 103.59 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity each year, enough to meet the needs of more than 25,000 households. By doing so, the facility will help cut over 37,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually.</p>



<p>The park features a state-of-the-art internal transformation station (110/20kV, 80 MVA), allowing efficient connection to Romania’s national power grid. This infrastructure plays a vital role in ensuring the stability and reliability of renewable energy integration.</p>



<p>In addition to the solar facility, Eurowind Energy is developing a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) on the same site. With a planned storage capacity of 116.96 megawatt-hours (MWh), the BESS represents a separate €43 million investment, of which €7.6 million comes from non-reimbursable PNRR funding.</p>



<p>Teiuș is the fourth solar park developed by Eurowind Energy in Romania, following successful projects in Hălchiu, Măgurele, and Pufești. The company expects to operate a total of 124 MW of local renewable capacity by the end of 2025. Its broader Romanian portfolio under development includes approximately 8 gigawatts (GW) of solar, wind, hybrid, and storage projects.</p>
